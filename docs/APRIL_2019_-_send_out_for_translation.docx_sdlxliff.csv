2;Temporary Medical License Disclaimer
3;Since we have been receiving quite a bit of feedback regarding documents needed for Temporary Medical Licenses to work in our mission countries, we wanted to provide clarity on the process and requirements.
4; Temporary Medical Licenses (TMLs) are occupational licenses that permit our volunteers to legally practice medicine in the mission countries. Regardless of where you practice medicine, if you are not from the country where the mission is taking place, you will need to apply for a TML through your program coordinator, volunteer manager or designated staff. They will acquire the TML from you for submission to the respective mission site country's Ministry of Health.
5;The TML process and document requirement for each country varies. The documents that program coordinators, volunteer managers or designated staff request are parameters set by the ministries of health and governments and are subject to change.
6;Even if you have been on a mission before, or are going back to a country for additional programs, please review the TML requirements each time you are confirmed to a program!
7;We greatly appreciate your flexibility and commitment to our teams!

11;Last month, program coordinators Bhaskar, John Paul and Bhavna Sharma led a successful mission in Bangalore, India. The mission was particularly impacted by their medical student volunteers whose positive attitudes aided in the effectiveness of the mission.
12;Program coordinators Danilo, Patricia and Arielle led their team through a prosperous mission in Asuncion, Paraguay. The team worked through language barriers to provide a safe and welcoming experience for our patients. At Asuncion Elementary School, the student team on this mission led a promising and fun health training session that taught students at the school techniques for brushing their teeth properly, tips for safe hand-washing and much more.
13; In Zunyi, China, program coordinators Christian, Merry and Emily led their team through a successful and productive mission. The team was joined by the Zunyi Women and Children's Hospital to celebrate their successes. One patient in particular had an impactful story that the Zunyi team had the privilege of sharing.
14; After seeing her son's cleft lip, this patient's mother abandoned him as a baby. Still full of hope and love for the child, his aunt took him in, determined to find a solution. When they heard about Operation Smile, the boy and his aunt traveled to Zunyi to receive care. After passing his comprehensive health evaluation, the boy was put on the mission schedule. It was an honor to perform safe surgery on this patient, and give him the confidence and dignity he deserves.
15;Meanwhile in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, the cooperation and collaboration across all specialties in this team equated to a successful and safe mission. Program coordinators Maria Cecilia and Vania Tally were happy to have talented and dedicated speech therapists on their team who worked alongside patients and their families to provide comprehensive care.
16;In Jimma, Ethiopia, program coordinators Kyra Brown and Abreham Haddiss had a delay in receiving their cargo. Instead of waiting around, the team decided to fill their extra day with lectures and small-scale training sessions for the anesthesiologist residents and nursing staff at the hospital! After receiving their supplies, the team and local volunteers held a great mission, providing care to patients like 18-year-old Getachew.
17; When Getachew and his friend Birhanu were at the Jimma University Hospital, someone noticed Getachew's cleft lip and mentioned Operation Smile and the March educational mission. After learning about the possibility of surgery, the two friends decided to travel to the mission together.
18;"I knew that mission was the only chance he would ever have to remove his stigmas,"""" Birhanu said. Getachew was screened for surgery and later put on the mission schedule."""
19;"During his initial screening of Getachew, plastic surgeon team leader, Dr. Per Hall, remembered saying, """"We are here to help."""" He stayed true to his word, and Getachew received his safe surgery on the final day of the mission. We couldn\'t be happier to see his results!"""
20; As Operation Smile missions occur simultaneously around the world, we prioritize the time to ensure that all patients are safe and receive complete care. It's a great privilege and joy to perform life-changing surgeries on our incredible patients.

48;Meet a Smile Hero
49;Whether he's running across the soccer field or running the show during his Operation Smile club's presentation, Brandon Prater is always on the move.
50;I don\'t let my surgeries stop me from doing anything I like to do, said Brandon, who was born with a cleft lip and cleft palate. The 10-year-old has had 36 surgeries to treat those conditions.
51;After months of going the extra mile for Operation Smile's patients â€” he's been fundraising to help even more children get the surgery they need â€” Brandon ran the Shamrock Operation Smile Final Mile with 5,000 of his peers at the Virginia Beach Oceanfront in March.
52; Operation Smile advocates like Brandon, who raised money and awareness for the cause, sported a special Smile Hero cape during the race as part of a new Final Mile initiative by Operation Smile Student Programs. It costs as little as $240 to provide life-changing surgery for a child with a cleft condition. So, every student who makes a new smile possible during the lead-up to next year's race will receive a special Smile Hero cape to wear as they finish the Final Mile.
