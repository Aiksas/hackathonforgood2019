314;Indoor-general
315;Never pour water down the drain when there may be another use for it. Use it to water your indoor plants or garden.
316;Indoor-bathroom
317;Check for toilet leaks by adding food coloring to the tank.
318;If you have a leak, the color will appear in the bowl within 30 minutes. (Flush immediately to avoid stains.)
319;Leaky toilets usually can be fixed inexpensively by replacing the flapper.
320;In the shower, turn the water on to get wet
321;Repeat when washing your hair.
322;Indoor-kitchen
323;"Run your automatic dishwasher only when it's fully loaded, using the ""light wash"" feature, if available."
324;Store drinking water in the refrigerator. Don't let the tap run while you are waiting for water to cool.
325;Defrost food overnight in the refrigerator, or use your microwave's defrost setting. Do not use running water.
326;Do not waste water waiting for it to get hot.
327;Capture it for other uses such as plant watering or heat it on the stove or in a microwave.
328;Garbage disposals require lots of water to operate properly. Throw food in the garbage.
329;Outdoor-general
330;If you have a well at home, check your pump periodically.
331;If the pump turns on and off while water is not being used, you have a leak.
332;Outdoor-lawn care
333;Only water your lawn every 5 to 7 days in the summer, and every 10 to 14 days in the winter. Heavy rain eliminates the need for watering for up to 2 weeks.
334;Most of the year, lawns only need 1 inch of water per week. A rain gauge can help you determine when to water.
335;Avoid sprinklers that spray a fine mist
336;Check sprinkler systems and timing devices regularly.
337;Avoid over-fertilizing your lawn. Fertilizing increases the need for water.
338;Apply fertilizers that contain slow-release, water-insoluble forms of nitrogen.
339;Earthquake
340;Earthquakes can be destructive over a huge area, shaking the ground and causing buildings to collapse. Learn what to do before and during an earthquake.
341;Before checklist
342;Bolt and brace water heaters and gas appliances to wall studs.
343;Bolt bookcases, china cabinets and other tall furniture to wall studs.
344;Hang heavy items, such as pictures and mirrors, away from beds, couches and anywhere people sleep or sit.

348;During- if indoors
349;DROP, cover and hold on. Move as little as possible and watch for falling objects.
350;It is most important to keep your head and torso covered. If you're sitting at a desk or table, get under it. Otherwise drop wherever you are.
351;If you are in bed, stay there, curl up and hold on, protecting your head with a pillow.
352;Stay away from windows to avoid being injured by shattered glass.
353;Stay indoors until the shaking stops and you are sure it is safe to exit.
354;If you must go outside after the shaking stops, use stairs rather than an elevator in case of aftershocks, power outages or other damage.
355;Be aware that fire alarms and sprinkler systems frequently go off in buildings during an earthquake, even if there is no fire.
356;During - if you are outside
357;Find a clear spot and drop to the ground. Stay there until the shaking stops (away from buildings, power lines, trees, streetlights).

370;Open cabinets slowly. Beware of objects that can fall off shelves.
371;Stay away from damaged areas in and around your home.
372;Look for and extinguish small fires. Fire is the most common hazard after an earthquake.
373;Check for gas leaks to prevent fires and secondary damage: Spray the fittings on your gas meter and any fittings on gas appliances with a mixture of water and a little liquid dish soap. If it bubbles there is gas present.
374;Use extreme caution and examine walls, floors, doors, staircases and windows to check for damage.

507;Food safety
508;Food may not be safe to eat during and after an emergency. Your state or local health department may make specific recommendations for boiling or treating water in your area after a disaster. Watch or listen to your local news for reports on the safety of your water and follow our tips below.
509;How to treat water
510;Boiling water is the safest method for killing harmful bacteria and parasites.
511;Strain water through a clean cloth to remove bulk impurities.
512;Bring water to a rolling boil and let it continue boiling for at least 1 minute.
513;This will kill most organisms, but not chemicals.
514;Let the water cool before drinking it.
515;Boiled water will taste better if you pour it back and forth between two clean containers.
516;If water is contaminated with chemicals, seek another source of water, such as bottled water.
517;If you can't boil water, you can treat it with chlorine tablets, iodine tablets or unscented household chlorine bleach.
518;If you use chlorine tablets or iodine tablets, follow the directions that come with the tablets.
519;To use household chlorine bleach:
520;Use chlorine bleach from a freshly opened bottle. Do not use scented bleaches, color-safe bleaches or bleaches with added cleaners.
521;Mix 1/8 teaspoon (approximately 8 drops) of bleach with a gallon of clear water. For cloudy water, use 1/4 teaspoon (approximately 16 drops) of bleach per gallon.
522;Mix the solution thoroughly and let it stand for about 30 minutes before using it.
523;If the water has a slight scent of chlorine, you can use it. If you can't smell chlorine, discard the water and find another source.
524;Preserve food when the power is out
525;Surround your food with ice in a cooler or in the refrigerator to keep food colder for a longer period of time.
526;Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible, using perishable foods first.
527;An unopened refrigerator will keep foods cold for about 4 hours.
528;Next use food from the freezer.
529;A full freezer will keep the temperature for about 48 hours (24 hours if it is half-full) if the door remains closed.
530;Use your non-perishable foods and staples after using food from the refrigerator and freezer.
531;If it looks like the power outage will continue beyond a day, prepare a cooler with ice for your freezer items.
532;Keep canned or packaged food in a dry, cool spot and keep it covered at all times.
533;If you are not sure a particular perishable food is cold enough, take its temperature with a food thermometer. It should be at 40Â° Fahrenheit (4Â°Celsius) or below.
534;Throw out any perishable foods (meat, poultry, fish, eggs and leftovers) that have been exposed to temperatures over 40Â° Fahrenheit (4Â°Celsius) for 2 hours or more.
535;Also throw out any food with an unusual odor, color or texture or feels warm to the touch.
536;Identify unsafe food
537;Throw away food that may have come in contact with flood or storm water or that has an unusual odor, color or texture.
538;Never taste food to determine its safety.
539;Some foods may look and smell fine, but if they have been at room temperature too long, bacteria that cause foodborne illness may have grown.
540;Some types of bacteria produce toxins that are not destroyed by cooking.
541;Throw away any fully cooked items in the freezer or the refrigerator that have come in contact with raw meat juices.
542;Throw away canned goods that are bulging, opened or damaged.
543;Throw away food containers with removable lids and home-canned goods that have come into contact with floodwater.
544;They cannot be disinfected.
545;Remember: When in doubt, throw it out!
546;Clean and sanitize food contact surfaces
547;Throw away wooden cutting boards, wood or plastic utensils, and baby bottle nipples and pacifiers that have come into contact with floodwater.
548;Use hot, soapy water to thoroughly wash metal pans, ceramic dishes and utensils that have come into contact with floodwater.
549;Sanitize dishes by boiling them in clean or properly treated water or by immersing them for 10 to 15 minutes in a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water.
550;Contaminated water
551;Contaminated water should not be used for any purpose.
552;Consider all water from wells, cisterns and other delivery systems in the disaster area to be unsafe until tested.
553;If you use bottled water, make sure it comes from a safe source.
554;If you are unsure where the water came from, boil or treat it first.
555;When the water supply is unsafe:
556;Use your emergency supply of water first.
557;Use water from melted ice cubes made before the disaster occurred.
558;Use water from undamaged hot water tanks and water pipes. Turn off the main water valve before draining water from these sources.
559;Bottled juices and the liquid from canned fruits and vegetables are another source of water.
560;If your water supply is limited, you can use alcohol-based hand sanitizers to clean your hands.
561;Clean and sanitize water-storage containers
562;Clean surfaces thoroughly with soap and water, then rinse.
563;For containers, add approximately 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water to make a bleach solution.
564;Close the container and shake the bleach solution thoroughly, allowing it to contact all inside surfaces.
565;Keeping the container closed, let the bleach solution stand for 30 minutes, and then rinse with clean drinking water.
566;Allow the container to air dry.

780;Our pets enrich our lives and depend on us for their safety and well-being. If you are a pet owner, the best way to ensure their safety is by including them in your family's disaster plan. Being prepared can help save lives.
781;How can I prepare
782;Take a Red Cross pet first aid course or purchase pet first aid guide books.
783;Plan to take your pets with you in an evacuation.
784;If it is not safe for you to stay, it is not safe for them either.
785;Know which hotels and motels along your evacuation route will accept you and your pets in an emergency.
786;Call ahead for reservations if you know you may need to evacuate. Ask if no-pet policies could be waived in an emergency.
787;Most Red Cross shelters cannot accept pets because of health and safety concerns and other considerations.
788;Service animals that assist people with disabilities ARE allowed in Red Cross shelters.
789;Know which friends, relatives, boarding facilities, animal shelters or veterinarians can care for your animals in an emergency.
790;Prepare a list with phone numbers and add to your cell phone.
791;Include your pets in evacuation drills so that they become used to entering and traveling in their carriers calmly.
792;Make sure that your pet's vaccinations are current and that all collars contain securely fastened, updated identification.
793;Many pet shelters require proof of current vaccinations to reduce the spread of disease.
794;"Consider having your pet ""microchipped"" by your veterinarian."
795;What should I do
796;Assemble a portable kit with emergency supplies for your pets.
797;Keep items in an accessible place and store them in sturdy containers so that they can be carried easily. Your kit should include:
798;Sturdy leashes, harnesses and/or carriers to transport pets safely and ensure that they can't escape.
799;Food, drinking water, bowls, cat litter/pan and a manual can opener.
800;Medications and copies of medical records stored in a waterproof container.
801;A first aid kit.
802;Current photos of you with your pet(s) in case they get lost.  Since many pets look alike, this will help to eliminate mistaken identity and confusion.
803;Information on feeding schedules, medical conditions, behavior problems, and the name and number of your veterinarian. This is in case you have to foster or board your pets.
804;Pet beds and toys, if easily transportable.
805;As the disaster approaches
806;At the first hint of disaster, act to protect your pet.
807;Often, warnings are issued hours, even days, in advance.
808;Call ahead to confirm emergency shelter arrangements for you and your pets.
809;Ensure that all pets are wearing collars with securely fastened, up-to-date identification.
810;Check that your pet disaster supplies are ready to take at a moment's notice.
811;Bring pets inside so you won't have to search for them if you need to leave quickly.
812;After
813;The behavior of pets may change dramatically after a disaster, becoming aggressive or defensive.
814;Be aware of their well-being and protect them from hazards to ensure the safety of other people and animals.
815;Watch your animals closely and keep them under your direct control as fences and gates may have been damaged.
816;Pets may become disoriented, particularly if the disaster has affected scent markers that normally allow them to find their home.
817;Be aware of hazards at nose and paw or hoof level.
818;Particularly debris, spilled chemicals, fertilizers and other substances that might not seem to be dangerous to humans.
819;Consult your veterinarian if any behavior problems persist.
820;Poisoning / harmful substances
821;Establish what they have taken. When? And how much?
822;As soon as possible, call poison control or get someone else to do it. Call ### if there is a change in behavior, they become unconscious or have difficulty breathing.
823;Call ###
824;Do not make the person sick or give them anything to drink unless advised to do so by poison control.

826;Poisoning / harmful substances
827;Establish what they have taken, when, and how much.
828;The emergency services will want to know this information.
829;Call poison control. Call ### if they become unconscious, have a change in behavior, have difficulty breathing, or if you think they are suicidal.
830;The substance could be extremely harmful and the person may need urgent medical attention.
831;Do not make the person sick or give them anything to drink unless instructed to do so by poison control.
832;By making them sick, you can cause further damage to their throat or block their airway.
833;What are poisons and harmful substances?
834;Drugs (prescription or non-prescription drugs), chemicals (including household cleaning products) and some plants can be harmful if you swallow them.
835;How can I tell if someone has taken poison or another harmful substance?
836;They may vomit and have abdominal pain. There may also be empty containers nearby.
837;Why shouldn't I make the person sick?

839;What should I do while I wait for the ambulance to arrive?
840;Get them to sit still and reassure them. Do not give them anything to drink.
841;What should I do if they go unconscious?

843;What should I do if they stop breathing?
844;I think the person has taken poison or another harmful substance, but they seem fine. What should I do?
845;Call poison control unless they become unconcious, have a change in behavior or have difficulty breathing. Then call ###.
846;Power outage

862;Never connect a portable generator directly into to a home's electrical system.
863;Connect only the equipment you want to power directly to the generator's outlets.
864;Never use a generator inside any partially or fully enclosed area.
865;Locate unit away from doors, windows and vents that could allow carbon monoxide to come indoors.
866;Carbon monoxide kills
867;Carbon monoxide poisoning is a hazard to avoid when using an alternate power source.
868;Install carbon monoxide alarms on every floor of your home.
869;When power returns
870;Throw away any food that has been exposed to temperatures 40Â° F (4Â° C) for 2 hours or more.
871;When in doubt, throw it out!
872;If food in the freezer is colder than 40Â° F and has ice crystals on it, you can refreeze it.

907;Psychological First Aid
908;Psychological first aid (PFA) is a set of actions that can offer immediate support and comfort to people affected by a critical event. People may be visibly distressed, affected by intense emotions, be apathetic or have lost hope. PFA is about providing basic, human support, delivering practical information and showing empathy, concern, respect and confidence in the abilities of the individual.
909;Four Basic elements of PFA
910;Stay close
911;You can help to rebuild an individual's trust and sense of security by staying physically close and by displaying care and empathy. Be prepared if the person appears anxious, displays extreme emotions, shouts or rejects help.
912;Listen Actively
913;Take the time to listen carefully in order to help someone going through a difficult time. Listen actively by asking clarifying questions, without probing.
914;Accept Feelings
915;People in crisis may display very different emotions. Accept the person's interpretation of the events and acknowledge their feelings.
916;Provide general care and practical help
917;Practical assistance, such as offering a glass of water, can be a great help. Avoid taking over more responsibility for the situation than the person actually needs.

941;Psychological First Aid
942;Observe and be aware
943;Look for indications that someone is experiencing a difficult situation and may benefit from PFA. Someone's behaviour can also indicate when you should NOT attempt PFA, such as when someone appears angry, violent toward others or intoxicated.
944;Make contact
945;In most circumstances, you will need to make the first move toward connecting and providing PFA to others. Say hello and give your name to get a conversation started. Tell the person where you are from and why you are there.
946;Keep safe
947;Remove the person from any dangers in the situation and from exposure to upsetting sights or sounds, the media or onlookers.
948;Provide quiet and privacy
949;Where appropriate and possible, find a private and quiet space for the person to rest or to talk.
950;Practical comfort
951;Assist with basic needs by offering practical comfort, like a glass of water or blanket.
952;Listen
953;Ask the person if they would like to talk about what happened, and listen carefully to any feelings and concerns they share.  If they do not want to talk, just stay with them.
954;Give realistic reassurance and normalise feelings
955;Reassure the person that their reactions are normal given the situation/distressing event. Respect and support the individual's feelings and reactions.
956;Help prioritize needs
957;Ask the person what they need and help them think through what is urgent and what can wait for later.
958;Connect with loved ones
959;Help the person connect to family or friends who can provide support.
960;Give accurate, timely information
961;Give factual information about what happened (if people ask), where and how to seek additional support. If possible, give the individual a card with a telephone number or address for where to find help.

963;Psychological First Aid
964;Which of the following are signs that someone may be experiencing distress?
965;Choose one or both
966;"The answer is all of the above. People may react in various ways to a crisis. Some examples of distress responses include: -Physical symptoms such as shaking, sweating, headaches, stomachaches, feeling tired, crying -Sadness, grief, irritability, anger guilt, shame, feeling emotionally numb -Anxiety, fear, confusion, not able to concentrate, disorientation -Appearing withdrawn or very still -Being ""on guard"" and ""jumpy"" -Not responding to others"
967;Correct!
968;Crying and sadness
969;Anxiety
970;There was a fire in the apartment complex next to your house. You notice a woman sitting by herself and struggling to hold back tears. What is the first thing you should you do?
971;Choose 1
972;The right answer is: Observe the situation and be aware. What you see and hear can be the first indication that someone is experiencing a difficult situation and may benefit from PFA. No matter what your relationship is to someone, your supportive actions in times of distress are usually welcomed by others.
973;Good answer!
974;"Tell the woman, ""It could have been a lot worse. You should feel lucky that you survived."""
975;Give the person a blanket and walk away.
976;Observe the situation and determine whether it would be appropriate and safe for you to provide PFA.
977;Leave the woman alone - you don't know her and she will handle the situation on her own.
978;You must be a trained mental health professional in order to provide PFA to distressed people.
979;Choose 1
980;The answer is False. PFA is not professional counselling or a clinical intervention. It is a supportive response for distressed individuals following a critical or traumatic event. Anyone can be trained on how to provide PFA to people.
981;That is right!
982;Psychological First Aid
983;Respect saftey, dignity and rights
984;Take the person's culture into account and adapt your actions to fit his/her cultural customs
985;Know when to ask for help and/or refer the individual to another resource
986;Take care of yourself. Look after yourself by eating a balance diet, taking breaks and resting enough, exercising, and sharing your feelings with people you trust.
987;Psychological First Aid for Children
988;Many children and adolescents can be especially vulnerable in a crisis situation. Young children may be at the greatest risk for harm or exploitation. Keep in mind that children react differently to critical events depending on their age, developmental stage, culture and gender. In general, children cope better when they have a stable, calm adult around them.
989;Road Safety
990;Road safety is important.
991;Always look both ways before crossing the street.
992;Cars sometimes arent looking at pedestrians. Be careful.

1106;Immobilize.
1107;Stabilize the injured area in the position it was found.
1108;Cold.
1109;Apply an ice pack to the injury. This will reduce the swelling and pain.
1110;Elevate.
1111;Elevate the injured part only if it does not cause more pain.
1112;How can I tell if someone has a strain or sprain?
1113;Strains and sprains are common injuries where there has been a sudden unusual movement to part of the body. The person may have pain, swelling and or bruising around a joint or muscle. If the injury is at a joint the person may have difficulty in moving a limb.
1114;What is the difference between an ice pack and a cold compress?
1115;An ice pack is ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in something such as a towel. This could also be called a cold compress. The only difference is that a cold compress doesn't have to use ice, it could also use something cold such as a towel soaked in cold water and wrung out. When using ice, be sure not to leave in direct contact with skin.
1116;If I don't have any ice, what can I use?
1117;If you don't have any ice you can use some frozen vegetables wrapped in a dish towel, for example.
1118;How long should I leave the ice pack on the injury?
1119;It is recommended that the ice stays on the injury wrapped in a dish towel for no longer than 20 minutes. Never place ice directly on the skin because it's too cold.
1120;What do I do after I have put an ice pack on the injury?
1121;Support the injured part of the body in a raised position and apply a bandage. The bandage should not be tightly wrapped around the injury. Periodically check that the bandage has not become tight.
1122;I was taught that to treat a strain or sprain, I should use RICE. Can I still use this?
1123;Yes, R.I.C.E. is a great way to remember how to treat a strain or sprain. The letters in R.I.C.E. stand for: Rest Immobilize Cold Elevate
1124;Should I call an ambulance?
1125;Most sprains and strains will respond to rest and cooling the injury. If you suspect that the bone is broken, if they are unable to walk, if the limb is angled, or if the pain is severe, then the person should go to the hospital.
1126;I've heard that you can use a warm cloth or alternate between warm and cold treatment. Is this wrong?
1127;This is not recommended first aid. Ice is the most effective way of reducing the swelling.
1128;What's the difference between a strain and a sprain?
1129;A strain is when a muscle is damaged. A sprain is when a joint, such as a knee, ankle or wrist is damaged.
1130;Stroke
1131;Think F.A.S.T.   Face: is there weakness on one side of their face?  Arms: can they raise both arms?  Speech: is their speech easily understood?  Time: to call ###.
1132;Strokes are caused by a disruption of the blood supply to the brain. Part of the brain becomes damaged, and this can affect people's appearance, bodily functions, speech and sight.
1133;Immediately call ### or get someone else to do it.
1134;A stroke needs immediate attention, and the faster the person receives medical help, the less damage is caused.
1135;Talk to the person to reassure them while you wait for the ambulance.
1136;What other symptoms do stroke victims have?
1137;Symptoms include: - difficulty expressing themselves or understanding other people.
1138;How can I help the person if they are frightened or anxious?
1139;Keep yourself calm so you can think more clearly and help the person who's having the stroke. Help them sit or lie down and reassure them that help is on its way.
1140;What if I can't understand what they are saying?
1141;Somebody who is having a stroke may have difficulty speaking clearly, but they may be able to understand what you say. Reassure them, speak slowly, and acknowledge that help is coming.
1142;Why do people have symptoms like a drooping face, a weak arm and slurred speech when they have a stroke?
1143;Strokes are caused by an interruption in blood supply to the brain. Brain cells become damaged and begin to die, which affects the body's functions. This may result in facial or limb weakness (sometimes only in one limb and sometimes down one side of the body).
1144;Why does a stroke tend to affect only one side of the body?
1145;One half of the brain controls one side of the body, while the other half controls the other side. Since disruption of blood flow to the brain generally involves only one side of the brain, only one side of the brain and body is affected.

1257;Tsunami
1258;Tsunamis are a series of large waves generated by major earthquakes beneath the ocean floor or major landslides into the ocean. Tsunamis can hit people on beaches or in low coastal areas within minutes after a severe earthquake. This danger period can last for many hours after a major earthquake.
1259;Before checklist
1260;Find out if your home, school, workplace or other frequently visited locations are in tsunami hazard areas.
1261;Buy a battery or hand-crank radio.
1262;Plan evacuation routes to areas 100 ft above sea level or 2 miles inland. If you can't, go as high and far away as you can.
1263;During a potential tsunami situation
1264;If you are in a coastal area and feel an earthquake that lasts 20 seconds or longer a tsunami may come within minutes.
1265;If you feel an earthquake, drop, cover and hold on.
1266;When the shaking stops, move quickly to higher ground away from the coast.
1267;Avoid downed power lines and stay away from buildings and bridges from which heavy objects might fall during an aftershock.
1268;Review evacuation plans with household members. Be ready to move quickly if a tsunami warning is issued.
1269;During a tsunami warning
1270;Take household members and get to higher ground as far inland as possible, taking your pets and your emergency preparedness kit with you.
1271;Watching a tsunami could put you in grave danger. If you can see the wave, you are too close to escape it.
1272;After
1273;Return home only after local officials tell you it is safe. A tsunami is a series of waves that may continue for hours.
1274;Do not assume that after one wave the danger is over. The next wave may be larger than the first one.
1275;Stay out of any building that has water around it. Tsunami water can cause floors to crack or walls to collapse.

1287;Unconscious breathing
1288;Check breathing by tilting their head backwards and looking and feeling for breaths.
1289;When a person is unconscious their muscles relax and their tongue can block their airway so they can no longer breathe. Tilting their head back opens the airway by pulling the tongue forward. Looking at their chest to see if it's moving, and feeling for breaths on your cheek, will help you tell if they're breathing or not.
1290;Move them onto their side and tilt their head back.
1291;Putting them in this position with their head back helps keep the airway open by making sure their tongue falls forward and blood and vomit drain out.
1292;Call ### as soon as possible, or get someone else to do it.
1293;How do I treat a baby who is unconscious and breathing?
1294;Place them in the recovery position by cradling them in your arms on their side, with their head tilted back. Call ### or get someone else to do it.
1295;Why do I have to tilt a person's head back to check for breathing?
1296;When anyone is unconscious, their tongue can fall backwards and block their airway. Tilting their head backwards opens the airway by pulling the tongue forward.
1297;If I think the person has a back or neck injury, should I still turn them on their side?
1298;If you suspect a back or neck injury, it is still advisable to move them onto their side. Your priority is to keep them breathing. Try to keep their spine in a straight line when turning them. If possible, get someone else to help you turn them.
1299;How do I look and feel for breaths?
1300;Once the head is tilted back, look to see if their chest is rising and falling. You may also feel breaths on your cheek.
1301;Is it called the 'recovery position' when you move a person onto their side and tilt their head back?
1302;Yes, 'recovery position' is the commonly used term to describe how an unconscious and breathing person should be placed so their airway stays open. Sometimes people get confused by the steps of putting someone in the 'recovery position', and they forget that the most important thing to do is get them on their side with their head tilted back.
1303;Should I try to talk with the person?
1304;Yes, talk to the person and reassure them. Even though they might not respond to you, they may still be able to hear what is going on.
1305;What should I do if someone is feeling faint?
1306;If someone is feeling faint, advise them to lie down on their back and raise their legs to improve blood flow to the brain. Fainting is caused by a temporary reduction in the flow of blood to the brain and can result in a brief loss of consciousness. A person who has fainted should quickly regain consciousness. If they don't, treat them as an unconscious person.

1320;Using an EpiPenÂ®
1321;Confirm the EpiPenÂ® is prescribed for the person, then remove the device from its carrier tube or package, if it has one.
1322;Check the expiration date. It is has expired, do not use the EpiPenÂ®.
1323;If the medication is visisble, make sure ht eliquid is clear. If it is cloudy, do not use it.
1324;Locate the outside middle of the person's thigh.
1325;Make sure there are no obstructions  at the site of injection such as a cell phone or keys.
1326;Grasp the EpiPenÂ® firmly in your fist with the needle end - the orange tip - pointed down. With the other hand, pull straight up on the blue safety cap without bending or twisting down.
1327;Do not put your thumb, fingers or hand over the ends.
1328;Hold the EpiPenÂ® with the needle end perpendicular to and near the outer thigh. Quickly and firmly push the tip straight into the outer thigh.
1329;You will hear a click indicating that the spring mechanism has been triggered.
1330;Hold the EpiPenÂ® firmly in place for 10 seconds to deliver the medication. Then, remove the auto-injector from the thigh and massage or have the person massage the injection area.
1331;Once the injection has been given, recheck the person's breathing and watch to see how they respond to the medication.
1332;You should also try to reassure the person to help him or her stay calm should you be waiting for the emergency services to arrive.
1333;If EMS is delayed and the person's symptoms do not improve or improve and then get worse again, administer a second dose of epinephrine using the same method.
1334;Remember a second device is needed.
1335;FAQ
1336;Do these instructions apply to all epinephrine injector devices?
1337;These instructions are based on the widely available EpiPenÂ®. If you are using a different epinephrine injector device, be sure to follow that manufacturer's instructions.
1338;Unconscious not breathing
1339;Check breathing by tilting their head backwards and looking and feeling for breaths.
1340;When a person is unconscious their muscles relax and their tongue can block their airway so they can no longer breathe. Tilting their head back opens the airway by pulling the tongue forward. Looking at their chest to see if it's moving, and feeling for breaths on your cheek, will help you tell if they're breathing or not.
1341;Call ### as soon as possible, or get someone else to do it. If breaths are felt, go to Unconcious Breathing in the Related First Aid section.
1342;If no breaths are felt, start chest compressions. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest and the heel of the other hand on top of the first, lacing your fingers together.
1343;Push firmly downwards in the middle of the chest and then release. Push hard and fast.
1344;These are called chest compressions. This keeps blood pumping around their body and helps keep the vital organs, including the brain, alive, and may dislodge an airway obstruction.
1345;Push at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, until help arrives.
1346;Let the chest rise completely before pushing down again.
1347;Full CPR (those certified only)
1348;Do I do chest compressions differently on a child or baby?
1349;The approach is the same, but chest compressions should be modified slightly for children or babies. For a child aged between one year old to twelve, use both hands and compress the chest about 2 inches. For a baby (under one year old), use the pads of two fingers and compress the chest about 1 1/2 inches.
1350;Why do I have to tilt their head back to check for breathing?
1351;When a person is unconscious, their tongue can fall backwards and block their airway. Tilting their head backwards opens the airway by pulling the tongue forward.
1352;How do I look and feel for breaths?
1353;Once the head is tilted back, look to see if their chest is rising and falling. If they are breathing, you may also feel breaths on your cheek.
1354;What are chest compressions?
1355;Chest compressions are where you place your hands in the center of the chest and repeatedly press downwards and release at a rapid rate to help pump the blood around the body.
1356;How long should I do chest compressions for?
1357;You should keep going until help arrives. If there is someone else who can help, change over every one to two minutes, with minimum interruption to chest compressions.
1358;Will I break their ribs?
1359;You might, but don't worry about this. Remember your priority is to keep the blood circulating. A damaged rib will mend, but without delivering chest compressions their chances of survival are significantly reduced.
1360;What if I'm on my own when I find someone unconscious and not breathing?
1361;If you are on your own, call ### before you start chest compressions.
1362;What if I make a mistake and do chest compressions, but the person is still breathing?
1363;It's not ideal but don't worry - there's no evidence to suggest you will cause any serious damage.
1364;Aren't I supposed to do mouth to mouth too?
1365;If you feel able to, you can combine chest compressions with breathing into their mouth or nose. However, giving chest compressions is the most important because their blood already has some oxygen in it and the compressions will keep that blood pumping about their body, taking oxygen to their brain. Breathing into their mouth or nose adds oxygen in their lungs. The combination of continuous cycles of 30 chest compressions followed by two breaths is called CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).
1366;How do I do mouth to mouth / rescue breaths?
1367;If you feel able to, after about 30 pushes on their chest, you can give two steady breaths into their mouth or nose. Seal your mouth over either their mouth or nose, closing the other, and blow air into them with two steady breaths. On a baby (under one year old), you need to seal your mouth around both their nose and mouth because their faces are so small.
1368;Will I restart the heart if I give chest compressions?
1369;The chance of restarting the heart by chest compressions alone is very low. To restart, a heart usually needs an electric shock from a defibrillator. Chest compressions pump a small amount of blood around the body to keep the organs - most importantly the brain - alive. You may not see any visible change in the person's condition, but don't give up. Chest compressions significantly increase the possibility of the person being successfully resuscitated when the emergency services turn up.
1370;What is a defibrillator?
1371;An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a machine that can be used to shock the heart back into normal rhythm. Once opened, the machine gives full instructions, usually verbal, on what to do.
1372;Can I use a defibrillator?
1373;Yes, you can use an automated external defibrillator (AED). Many public places, such as train stations and shopping centers, now have one available. The machine may not shock the person if that isn't the best action to take. Even when the machine does shock them, it doesn't always mean that their heart will restart afterwards.
1374;What should I do if someone has been in a drowning accident and is unconscious and not breathing?
1375;"Do not enter the water unless you are specifically trained to perform in-water rescues.  Get help from a trained responder, such as a lifeguard, to get the person out of the water as quickly and safely as possible.  Then, if the person is not breathing, you will have to give proper care. This entails giving rescue breaths in addition to chest compressions to build up a supply of oxygen in the blood. After about 30 pushes on their chest  give two steady breaths into their mouth or nose. To do this seal your mouth over either their mouth or nose  closing the other  and blow air into them with two steady breaths. On a baby (under one year old)  you need to seal your mouth around both their nose and mouth because their faces are so small. Continue this cycle of 30 compressions followed by two breaths until help arrives."""

1377;A person who has been bitten will feel pain. Look for fang marks and swelling.
1378;Call ### immediately if a person is bitten by a venomous snake.
1379;Gently wash the wound.
1380;Keep the bitten part still and lower than the heart. Keep the person calm and do not allow him or her to walk unless absolutely necessary.
1381;Which snakes are venomous and what do they look like?
1382;Venomous snakes include the rattlesnake, copperhead, cottonmouth and coral snake.
1383;What are signals of envenomation (poisoning)?
1384;Signals of moderate envenomation include nausea, vomiting and tingling. Signals of severe envenomation include shock, coma and paralysis.
1385;Should I apply ice to the bite or use a tourniquet?
1386;No, do not apply ice or a tourniquet to a venomous snake bite. Also, do not cut the wound, do not apply suction and do not use electric shock.
1387;Volcano
1388;Explosive volcanoes blast hot solid and molten rock fragments and gases into the air. As a result, ashflows can occur on all sides of a volcano and ash can fall hundreds of miles downwind. Dangerous mudflows and floods can also occur in valleys leading away from volcanoes.
