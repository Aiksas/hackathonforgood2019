1;Dianova International led the organization of a Parallel Event at the CSW61 to exchange best practices in the field of migrant women's economic empowerment
2;half of the world's migrant population Women and girls account for . When in conflict zones and forced to move, or when they migrate to escape poverty, for family reunion, or to search for economic opportunities and education, women and girls often combine the challenges of migrating with pre-existing gender-based forms of vulnerabilities. In this context, exposure to violence, human trafficking, abuse, discrimination, neglect, sexual exploitation and assault can be aggravated if women do not have access to sustainable income-generating activities of their own in the countries of destination.
3;Women's economic empowerment have the power to increase women's capacities to become the primary agent of their own lives and choices. It can also effectively safeguard women from exploitation and from informal, uncertain, and underpaid jobs. Ultimately, women's economic empowerment sets the grounds for women to live in freedom and independency. Nevertheless, reality shows that cultural differences, language barriers, restrictive gender-roles and religious practices, lack of education, household responsibilities, denial of work permits, insufficient or inexistent integration processes, often limit women's possibilities to thrive in the job market.

9;Peace Island Institute Journalists and Writers Foundation Finally, Nuray Yurt, Vice-President of  and of , concluded the panel with a striking reminder: every time a highly educated migrant women and a migrant women of whichever background is marginalized at the labor market due to discrimination against her gender, culture, religion or ethnicity, the entire society loses. Certainly, when we are finally to add to the equation the lost capacities so far obstructed by inequality, prejudice and discrimination, the development of societies will see no limits. So we must continue to build upon the conclusions and exchanges of the CSW61 until every migrant woman is safe and is empowered to thrive.
