# Hackathon for good 2019 - Translators without borders challenge

Code produced by team Lazy Pandas for the challenge provided by Translators without borders.

This repo contains
- code to label unlabeled texts using a list of predefined topics, their synsets, and word embeddings
- code to apply a random forest model where we train a model on a set of characteristics of a text (e.g. label, number of inhabitants country, etc) and the priority score of that text.
